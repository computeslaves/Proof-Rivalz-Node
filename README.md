Rivalz Network Testnet: The Minez Node Quest


Rivalz introduces an AI Intel Layer powering an ecosystem of modular AI-apps. A DePIN-based RollApp built on top of Dymension, using Celestia and Eigen.
Rivalz believe that the future of AI Data will heavily focus on data provenance, which will be the core to building the largest AI Data Markets, enabling AI-apps and a diverse ecosystem of AI Agents.

Furthermore, AI-applications, such as AI-agents, need trusted and validated access to data feeds and domain-specific intelligence. This problem needs significant advancement both on the coordination and trust layers. 

The Rivalz Network AI DePIN Layer consists of rNodes and Validator zNodes.
1. Validator zNodes are used as a settlement solution for the inflows and outflows of Data from the DePIN Layer.
2. Light rClients allow users to contribute data space and limited compute from their devices. rClients are available for anyone to run.
